My configurations for vim.

These configs work best with Vim 7.4


Issues:

1. there seems to be a conflict with my mapping for nerdtree - <leader>tr -
   haven't yet found a cause, however, opening and closing my vimrc file seems
   to 'force' the mapping to 'take'...odd(?)
2. I've yet to get my head around git-modules (I get the theory) so haven't
   utilized these for, eg plugins. Those directories will be 'empty'.
